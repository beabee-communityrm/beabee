					p.
						At the Cable we’re committed to creating quality local journalism
						that holds power to account, amplifies diverse voices and
						highlights new ideas. Over the past five years, members have
						contributed to making this happen, by prioritising what topics we
						cover, voting on key questions like whether we should do
						campaigning journalism, and choosing the campaign itself. 

					p.
						Our key aims for the upcoming year are: 

					ol
						li.
							Reach more people online with innovative journalism, and get them
							to become members!
						li.
							Build deeper relationships with individuals and communities, to
							develop trust and input from across the city

					p.
						We’ve got ideas for strategies on how best to reach these aims. But
						we can’t do both at the same time, because we don't have the
						resources or capacity. This is why we’re asking members to help
						decide which to prioritise, by thinking about what is most
						important right now. For example:

					ul
						li What should be the Cable’s focus?
						li What will help improve membership growth?
						li What’s the best way to create impactful journalism?
						li What’s the best way to have diverse contributors and audience?

					p.
						You can also share what other things you think the Cable should
						focus on.

					p.
						Once members have contributed, the Cable team will come up with a
						plan on how to enact the favoured strategy and will update you all
						in due course. Cheers!

						p.
							Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts, your input is
							really valuable to the Cable.
							
						p.
							We'll be collecting people's feedback over the next couple of
							weeks and you can expect an update with a summary of the themes
							and learnings shortly afterwards.

								h3 Which editorial strategy should we prioritise?

								.poll-agm2019-editorial-strategy
									h4 Strategy 1: A “Far and Wide” strategy - Video journalism

									p.
										The Cable needs to focus on growing its digital audience as
										this will increase membership growth and impact. The use of
										quality video journalism is an original way for local
										journalism to reach new and larger audiences.

									p: b What do we mean by video journalism?

									ul
										li Short investigative documentaries - taking a leaf out of our written reporting but turning it into video content. 
										li Short ‘myth busting’ videos, debunking fake news, and reporting on matters of public interest 
										li Short documentaries featuring the unsung stories of local communities, innovation and inspiring work in Bristol
										li Exclusive video interviews to accompany  articles and bolster digital reach
										li Short  ‘visual investigation’ videos - using pioneering methods of editing maps, photography, and social media content to tell stories

								.poll-agm2019-editorial-strategy
									h4 Strategy 2: A “Concentrated and Deep” Strategy - Community journalism

									p.
										The Cable should prioritise  community engagement in its
										journalism to build deep relationships with specific
										communities. Local news organisations rarely do community
										engagement, meaning we can secure a niche in this area.

									p: b What do we mean by community journalism?

									ul
										li A roaming newsroom visiting different communities to get tip-offs, feedback on the stories we publish and increase visibility and trust.
										li A series of articles on the issues affecting specific neighbourhoods and/ or underrepresented communities in media
										li Co-producing journalism and events with individuals and communities
										li Roundtable discussions to amplify the voices of local communities on matters of local concern
										li Speaker events/ workshops hosted in local communities on issues of concern which have been reported on by the Cable
