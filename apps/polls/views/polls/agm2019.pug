					p.
						We’re pleased to invite you to the Bristol Cable Annual General
						Meeting 2019, where Cable members help steer the co-op for the year
						ahead.

					p.
						The AGM is the most important moment in the Cable year for us all
						to come together, reflect, celebrate and make big plans for what’s
						next. We’ll be electing new directors and working through some
						important questions together. As well as marking the Cable’s 5th
						Birthday!

					p.
						The AGM will be a lively event with interactive activities,
						interesting conversation, cups of tea and delicious snacks! For a
						flavour of the event take a look at this video of last year. 

					p The event is child-friendly and there will be a creche / play area.
