						We believe journalism isn’t just about information. It’s about
						empowering our communities and making a difference.

					p.
						In 2017 Bristol Cable members voted to create lasting change through
						dogged, creative and impactful campaigning journalism. Since then we
						have chalked up several wins.

					p.
						Over the past months, Cable members have contributed to planning our
						next campaign. 

					p.
						And it’s now time to have you say and vote for what we do next!

					h4 Campaign 1: Prevent drug deaths and clean up our streets!

					p.
						Every day, people who use drugs risk infection and overdose. Many
						residents feel unsafe and find thousands of needles in our parks.
						Police time is wasted fighting a public health crisis. And the NHS
						picks up the pieces. 

					p.
						But it doesn’t have to be this way. 

					p.
						Safe drug consumption rooms are medical facilities where people take
						illegal drugs and receive support to get clean. These services improve
						rehab rates, reduce drug deaths, crime, infections, public injecting
						and needle litter. 

					p.
						They are pioneered in more than 10 countries, but the government
						remains opposed. Now a growing number of charities, politicians, senior
						police and local authorities are backing them.

					p.
						This campaign would drum up support and call on the council to work
						with the police, community groups and public bodies to set up a safe
						consumption room in Bristol immediately. 

					h4 Campaign 2: We want clean air. Let’s fight for it.

					p.
						At a busy junction or in your neighbourhood, the very air we breathe is
						doing us harm.

					p.
						A day spent on the streets of Bristol does as much damage as smoking
						between 1–2 cigarettes. Approximately 300 deaths every year are
						attributable to air pollution. 

					p.
						Countless others suffer, with children and people in working class
						neighbourhoods hit hardest. 

					p.
						This can, and must, change.

					p.
						From industry to fuel, transport to research, the problems – and
						solutions – are wide-ranging. 

					p.
						But the solutions will only be implemented if we push for it. 

					p.
						Through a series of coverage and working with allies and community
						groups the Cable will investigate the sources and solutions to
						Bristol’s dirty air and then push for action, from companies, the
						authorities and the public. 

					p.
						It’s time we all breathed a little easier.
